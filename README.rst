aprs - Python APRS Module
*************************

aprs is a Python Module that supports connecting to APRS Interfaces, and
receiving, parsing and sending APRS Frames.

Included are several Interface Classes:

* APRS - Abstract Class from which all other Connection Interfaces are inherited.
* TCP - Connection Interface Class for connecting to APRS-IS via TCP. Can send or receive APRS Frames.
* UDP - Connection Interface Class for connecting to APRS-IS via UDP. Only supports sending APRS Frames.
* HTTP - Connection Interface Class for connecting to APRS-IS via HTTP. Currently only supports sending APRS Frames.

Frame and Callsign classes are included:

* Frame - Describes the components of an APRS Frame.
* Callsign - Describes the components of an APRS Callsign.

Versions
========

- 6.5.x branch will be the last version of this Module that supports Python 2.7.x
- 7.x.x branch and-on will be Python 3.x ONLY.

Installation
============
Install from pypi using pip: ``pip install aprs``


Usage Examples
==============

Example 1: Library Usage - Receive
----------------------------------

The following example connects to APRS-IS as W2GMD (me!) and filters for APRS
frames coming from my prefix (W2GMD, W2GMD-n, etc). Any frames returned are
sent to my callback *p* and printed.

Example 1 Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    import aprs


    def p(x):
        print(x)


    a = aprs.TCP(b"W2GMD", b"12345")
    a.start()

    a.receive(callback=p)

Example 1 Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    W2GMD-6>APRX28,TCPIP*,qAC,APRSFI-I1:T#471,7.5,34.7,37.0,1.0,137.0,00000000

Example 2: Library Usage - Send
----------------------------------

The following example connects to APRS-IS as W2GMD (me!) and sends an APRS
frame.

Example 2 Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    import aprs

    frame = aprs.parse_frame("W2GMD>APRS:>Hello World!")

    a = aprs.TCP(b"W2GMD", b"12345")
    a.start()

    a.send(frame)

Testing
=======
Run nosetests from a Makefile target::

    make test

Errata
======

7.0.0rc1 - Currently setting/getting digi flag on KISS frames is broken. Expect it to
be fixed in final release of 7.0.0.
